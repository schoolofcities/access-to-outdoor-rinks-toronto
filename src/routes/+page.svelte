            Cities with colder climates, like many in Canada, 


            - Why skating rinks are important, cite 2-4 pieces of key literature/new articles
            - Briefly on history of skating rinks in Toronto, how many are there? what do they offer (public skating/hockey/classes/can be booked for activities)
        </p>
        <p>
            While there are over 50 outdoor rinks in Toronto, there are large swaths of the City that do not live close to a rink and thus have to travel long distances to access them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below we've created a map showing the locations of outdoor skating rinks, with the background coloured by the travel time in each neighbourhood to the nearest skating rink. This is a type of <a href="">isochrone map</a>.
